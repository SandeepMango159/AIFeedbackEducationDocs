## This is pretty revolutionary for the local LLM scene!

New paper just dropped. 1.58bit (ternary parameters 1,0,-1) LLMs, showing performance and perplexity equivalent to full fp16 models of same parameter size. Implications are staggering. Current methods of quantization obsolete. 120B models fitting into 24GB VRAM. Democratization of powerful models to all with consumer GPUs.

Probably the hottest paper I've seen, unless I'm reading it wrong.

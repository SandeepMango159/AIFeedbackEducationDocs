In this worsened submission, I simplified the language and omitted specific details about giraffes' adaptations and habitat. Additionally, I made the comparison with polar bears superficial and did not provide a detailed analysis of the differences in adaptations between the two species. Overall, the analysis lacks depth and scientific accuracy, failing to meet the requirements outlined in the assignment instructions.

# Adaptation Analysis Assignment

## Intro
This section will discuss the research for the AI feedback tool around the Adaptaion Analysis Assignment from the Biology course. 


## Assignment
This is an open ended assignment with instructions for guidance. These denote what is expected of the submitted work while still allowing flexibility and interpretation for how they approach their work. Essentially, they're given a framework to follow.

Students are tasked with selecting specific organisms and conducting research on their habitat, behavior, physical characteristics, and adaptations. The assignment encourages critical thinking and application of adaptation concepts to real-world examples.

The assignment can be found [here](Assignment.md)

## Template Solutions
During the generation of feedback, template solutions were provided to the AI along with the assignment. These were generated beforehand with the help of AI by the teacher of this course. They reviewed them and improved them if necessary. These solutions are what is considered a good solution if it was a student submission.

These template solutions serve as reference points for the AI, enabling it to analyze student submissions and provide tailored feedback.

The student should not know these exist, therefore the AI can not name the template solutions or reference them when giving feedback.


## Assesment
In general, when assessing the effectiveness of the AI feedback tool, we focus on its ability to provide comprehensive and meaningful feedback to students. Several aspects we'll be looking at:

- General Hallucinations: The AI should not make up things when giving feedback. For example, it should not say a made up part of your assignment is wrong, or quote things wrongly.

- Limitations in understanding: The AI might not know all the facts about a certain course and it's material. Therefore, fact checking etc should be heavily restricted or not allowed.

- Usage of template solutions: The template solutions should adhered to when the AI grades student solutions, things such as structure, outline, etc... But it should stay flexible, as template solutions are only a representation of what a "good" solution looks like, not what a perfect solution looks like. Template solutions should also be kept secretive, as explained in the section above.

- Consistency: The feedback should stay consistent throughout different students and their submissions, meaning for one student it shouldn't be more elaborate or concise than for another. 

- Hints: The feedback should be in the form of hints, no form of explicit solution to the assignment should be given. Examples also shouldn't be given, as these are things the student has to research themselves.

- Instruction following: The rest of the general instructions in the assignment should be followed.

- Target age and education: Language is used that is understandable to someone of the target age and education. No terminologies etc should be introduced that are too complex for the student, conversely, ensure the feedback is not overly simplified, as this may hinder the student's learning process.

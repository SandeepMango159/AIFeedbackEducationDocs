Hi, I'm a teacher for the course Biology, I want you to act as my assistent teacher. I have an assignment with some instructions. 

Now, what I want you to do is generate me some solutions for this assignment. I want to use these template solutions to grade the students' submissions by comparing their submission to all of your solutions, so I can grade them easier and faster. I might even use an AI to compare the stubdents' submissions to generated solutions and let it grade them. 

I want you to give me a solution one by one, and each time I'll give feedback to that solution. I'll say wether the solution is good or bad. After that, please send your next solution. 

Here are the assignment's instructions, after reading them, please provide me with your first solution:

This solution is good. Now, please send your next solution.

This solution can be better. It is accurate but I don't like that for "large paws and sharp claws" you're repeating alot throughout your solution.

<p>When you’re feeling down, Kayla recently had to lift weights. However, she’s not just lifting weight — she loves it too! We were happy to see her song, Misery, performed at MIDK, concert last fall at Grimes Field. Check out the video for “Misery.”</p>
<p>2016 was a difficult year for my parents and me. Harder than any other because it was down to the blessed ability of our grandfather A. John Warlich to massively raise cash and look after some of us while Bill and his family went to Sandy from Noblesburg when he was a leading chaperone at Columbus High School. But thanks to him we got the results we need!
During 2016 of course the only thing that left me was to miss Mike Contreras medalous racing at the Brookline SCX-Caldera Holiday Classic, which was mostly flawless until our membership was sold out! But looking back on it it takes a really long time for your sense of fate to kick in. Don’t let that stop you, leave some time to make some memories, revise your routes, be creative so many decades from now your memory will be engraved.
Picking up places at the end of 2016 and helping our parents get a cup of coffee focused on 2006. It wasn’t all easy. Some of those nights I had a boy and his mother showed up on my doorstep that night looking like something out of a horror movie with blond hair and a yen for basketball. That first year was hostile.
Hard Hardcore Saturday Special presents the Boys Christmas Getaway with “DREAMERS’ PROFILE” featuring Eldon High School seniors. I came in at 3rd and with three other players 6 draws later at the “spinner”, the top took a 4 to 1 chance at scoring the victory.

<p>Students will be challenged to formulate basic questions, carry out both passive and active research, and base their analyses/researches on a selection of information sources. End-of-unit assessment includes a rubric, a two-page reader, and an in-class project. Included in this lesson are creative assignments that require students to look at large samples of an adapted organism and write a variety of types of reports based on their findings. The readings are grouped into topics devoted to specific adaptations that focuses on research design, population consideration, effects, and biological concepts. Grade level appropriate vocabulary lists are provided as well. Over 28 pages</p>
<p>Beneath the vibrant buildings of Phnom Penh lies one of the world’s largest manmade canals, the Tonle Sap.
Underwater sediments from the south stems from a volcanic plateau, are elevated by 300 meters and filled with low density sediments such as sand and silt from the north with higher density sediments from the east arising from the Missajiang plain.
The water flow, characterized by a triangular extremely low frequency oscillation (UFOHa), takes turns to the left, west and right, flowing through the narrowest part of the width of the dam. This mixing results in a laminar current in which the water flow is very uniform and is at the level near the lowest third of the dam.
A series of corrective interventions in the thirty-six years of operation have compensated for the deterioration caused by frequent flooding and high sedimentation. However, in the late twenty first century, an impeller called Fossil was built to replace Fossil. While this augmentation will reduce the use of pebbles and granular sand in the operations of the Dam, it is predicted that additional erosion along the laminar flow, directly affecting the output of the Dam, will be a factor to consider.
Analysis of the calculations and data in this project will also allow for a better understanding of the hydrological regime at the dam and the experience necessary to design hydroelectric projects for operation at the broader level.</p>
<p>At 0247 this morning, eight hundred runners turned out for a run around the ring of Portsmouth lake in unseasonably cool temperatures. Another 630 would fill the waterlogged park in the morning. The relatively tranquil nature of the only marathon in the city today – the Virgin London Marathon - had united somewhat, though there was plenty of misery and heartbreak throughout.
The race gained celebrity status earlier in the day when David Beckham and Anna Maxwell Martin, pictured here all glammed up for a magazine shoot, took to the starting line first. They are up in London supporting the start of the London 2012 Olympics and running as part of the 11th campaign by the FIFA school of sport.

I originally wanted to build a nipple on the pump that would have a kid safe sprayable no-stick lube. But, later, it occurred to me that I could hold the bottle and press the spray valve as if it were a spray bottle.
I did this for a week or so and the result has been giving me plenty of time to play with the model before it actually regauged again. I think it looks great!

<p>Here are some cool facts about New Mexico: ranked number 4 for highest children's book author population, has the only dinosaur bone museum in the United States, and three U.S. senators were born here. But, not many know that there is a ghost Spanish fort on the north side of Bernalillo that is named for a celebrated Native American hero.
The man known as Mescalero was a legendary New Mexican warrior of the early 1700s. Holding troop examinations, he was said to have cleared 5,000 Boy Scouts. Mescalero disappeared before he could take his troop excursion to New Mexico's only mountain – the one that we see in the famous photograph of a slave girl riding a white man's horse. Legend has it that a fellow student wanted to come along, and Mescalero killed him, and served his body up to the mountain's spirits as a burnt offering.
Inspired by the backstory, "Mescalero: His Life and Death" by John O'Keefe and illustrated by Peter King has been a huge New Mexico success. Set not in more modern times, but</p>

<p>The first thing you notice about the new BMW M5 is that it’s a lot bigger than the previous model. The new M5 is a full 2.5 inches longer, and 1.5 inches wider. It’s also a lot heavier, tipping the scales at 4,835 pounds.
The new M5 is powered by a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 that produces 600 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque. That’s a significant increase over the previous model’s 4.4-liter V8, which produced 456 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque.
The new M5 is also the first BMW to feature an eight-speed automatic transmission. The transmission is mated to a new all-wheel-drive system that features a rear-biased torque split.
BMW says the new M5 will hit 60 mph in 3.4 seconds, and reach a top speed of 189 mph.
The new M5 will be available in the U.S. in the spring of 2017. Pricing has not yet been announced.</p>

<p>This assignment, and the two in the next section, are based on a news story about a mountain climber climbing Mount Everest. You may not use the story for your assignment.
Step-by-step Guide (Printable)
Students may choose to select this assignment at any time during the semester. This assignment is designed to be completed over at least two class periods. It should ideally be completed in class, or if students were out when this assignment was assigned, it may be completed in homework, or as a follow-up after a class discussion.
Description
Students should read the news story linked in the section above titled "Mountain Climber Climbs Mount Everest," and carefully evaluate the adaptation of the climbers' own bodies. This is a very specific example, since you get information from the story rather quickly. Students should also consider how they might apply this information to a larger population, including athletes in college sports.
How should these questions guide students in their analysis?</p>
<p>In an exclusive video interview with Polygon, Blizzard Entertainment's senior game director explained how World of Warcraft is still evolving. He also revealed that one of the greatest changes to the game is the introduction of guild housing.
"The great thing about it is there's not just one house," said J. Allen Brack, senior game director at Blizzard Entertainment. "It's a building block. You can do any type of structure you want in your house."
"You've got the ability to do all sorts of different guild-specific things," he added.
Brack said some guild leaders might make their base out of wood, while others might choose stone.
"There's no limits to what you can do in your base," he said.
Brack added: "We're also making the structures interactive. If you've got a big stone base, it's great for that. If you've got a water wall in your wood base, it's great for that. You can put your flag pole, or you can put a banner there. Those buildings are all living things. You can interact with them at any time in game."
World of Warcraft has a new housing system, too. According to Brack, people in Azeroth can "now look up and say, 'I want to go to the top of that mountain.' "
That being said, Brack added that it's up to players how they will use things like this. They can, after all, go skiing on their mount (if they want to take the time to level it to level 70).

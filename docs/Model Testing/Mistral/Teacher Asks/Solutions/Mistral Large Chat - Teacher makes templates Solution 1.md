Title: Adaptation Analysis: The Polar Bear and The Camel

Introduction:
Adaptation is a process that enables organisms to survive and thrive in their specific environments. This essay will analyze the adaptations of the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and compare them with those of the camel (Camelus dromedarius).

Organism and Habitat:
The polar bear is a large, carnivorous mammal that inhabits the Arctic Circle, including the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. The Arctic is characterized by freezing temperatures, snow, and ice.

Adaptations:
1. Thick Fur and Blubber: Polar bears have a thick layer of fur and a layer of blubber underneath, providing insulation against the cold. The fur is also water-repellent, allowing them to swim in icy waters.
2. Large, Paddle-like Feet: Polar bears have large, paddle-like feet, which are excellent for swimming and walking on ice. They can swim long distances in search of food.
3. Keen Sense of Smell: Polar bears have an exceptional sense of smell, which they use to locate seals, their primary food source, even when they are under the ice.

Comparison:
The camel, on the other hand, is a large, herbivorous mammal adapted to life in the desert. The desert is characterized by extreme heat during the day, cold at night, and scarcity of water.

1. Humps: Camels have humps that store fat, which can be converted into water and energy when resources are scarce.
2. Large, Flat Feet: Camels have large, flat feet that prevent them from sinking into the sand.
3. Thick Fur on Top and Thin Fur on the Underbody: This adaptation helps camels to stay cool during the day and warm at night.

Conclusion:
Both the polar bear and the camel have unique adaptations that allow them to survive in their harsh environments. The polar bear's adaptations are geared towards surviving in the cold and finding food in the ice, while the camel's adaptations are designed to cope with the heat and water scarcity of the desert. These adaptations highlight the importance of evolution in enabling organisms to survive and thrive in diverse habitats.

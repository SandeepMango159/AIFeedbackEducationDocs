# Student Asks Feedback

## Intro
Welcome to the Student Asks Feedback chapter. In this chapter, we discuss our research on the AI based feedback system, but this time we will delve into the student's perspective.

It is tested by us pretending to be a student and submitting our work for an assignment to get feedback from the AI. We will follow up the feedback by submitting an improved version of our work that incorporates the previous feedback and asking for subsequent feedback. This might continue for multiple times. 

Below, you can find an overview of all the courses that we have tested during our research. Each course has assignments which are tested in both Dutch and English. 

## Biology

This course contains open ended assignments which were tested with template solutions.

In this course, students learn and practice the Dutch language, focusing on grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and writing skills. Our AI-based feedback system is designed to assess student assignments in Dutch, taking into account language proficiency and adherence to the instructions provided.
